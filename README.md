When your work in complete, push up the branch (`git push origin quiz`) and submit the pull request on Github.

## Instructions

### Code/Tools Requirements

1. Use ES6 language features wherever you can. At a minimum, you should be using **let**, **const**, fat arrows, property shorthand, method properties, and string templates.
1. Have a Gulp task running at all times to validate your JavaScript. We will be validating your project and we should see 0 errors.
1. You must have a test suite that validates the core logic of the application.
1. You must use jQuery for interacting with the DOM.

### Base Logical Requirements

You'll be building robots to battle each other.

1. A base Robot function.
1. Define three robot type functions (e.g. Drone, Bipedal, ATV).
1. Define at least 2 specific robot model functions for each type.
1. Give each robot model a different range of health. For example, one model can have health range of 50-80, and another one will have a range of 60-120. To accomplish this, read about the [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) function in JavaScript.
1. Give each robot model a different range of damage they do using the same technique.

### Base Functional Requirements

1. When your user interface first loads, provide 2 text inputs to name the two robots that will do battle.
1. You must also provide a select element underneath each text input so that the user can select one of the 6 robot models you defined.
1. Provide a Attack! button that, when clicked, simply applies the damage output of each robot against the other one.
1. Once either robot's health is <0 display a message that the battle is over, and which one won. For example...

##### The Viper Drone defeated the Behemoth ATV with its flamethrower.
